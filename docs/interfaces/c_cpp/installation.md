## Installing using conda

PIQP can be directly installed via anaconda/miniconda:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge piqp
```

## Building and Installing from Source

{% root_include _common/building_from_source_deps.md %}

### Building and Installing PIQP

* Clone PIQP from Github
```shell
git clone https://github.com/PREDICT-EPFL/piqp.git
```
* Build PIQP in a `build` folder
```shell
cd piqp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF
cmake --build . --config Release
```
Note that by setting `-march=native`, we allow the compiler to optimize for the full available instruction set on the machine compiling the code.
* Install libraries and header files (requires CMake 3.15+)
```shell
cmake --install . --config Release
```
This will install the C++ and C headers and shared libraries.

{: .note }
If you want to build static libraries instead, you can pass `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` when configuring cmake.

## Using PIQP in CMake Projects

PIQP has first class support for CMake project. The C++ library is header-only. For the C interface we provide a shared as well as a static library which can be linked against.

```cmake
# Find PIQP package
find_package(piqp REQUIRED)

# PIQP requires at least C++14
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

# Link the PIQP C++ library with precompiled template instantiations
target_link_libraries(yourTarget PRIVATE piqp::piqp)

# Link the PIQP C++ header-only library
target_link_libraries(yourTarget PRIVATE piqp::piqp_header_only)

# Link the PIQP C library
target_link_libraries(yourTarget PRIVATE piqp::piqp_c)
```
